#   --------  Access Control and Debug Options  --------
#           These modifiers help maximize simulation performance while retaining
#           access to objects of interest, which might otherwise be optimized
#           away. By default, this option has effect on all design units in the
#           design. +<selection> can be used to target the extent of this option
#           to only a specified design unit or instance using following syntax:
#              [<library>.]<entity>[(<architecture>)] (for VHDL design units)
#              [<library>.]<design_unit> (for Verilog design units)
#              <inst_name> (for Verilog/VHDL design regions, and objects)
#              [<library>.]<design_unit>/<inst_path> (for Verilog/VHDL instances)
#           When [<library>.]<design_unit> is specified, all instances of that
#           design unit from the specified <library> are affected by this
#           option. If <library> is not specified, all instances of that design
#           unit are considered. In VHDL, a user may further qualify the
#           selection using <architecture>.
#           When +<inst_name> is specified, only objects in that part of the
#           design are affected.
#           If a trailing '.' is present, the option is also applied recursively
#           downwards. Or, a user can specify the number of recursion levels
#           (0 to 127) with this option. Recursion level 128 indicates full
#           recursion.
# 
#                      Examples:
#                         VHDL Design Unit:    -floatgenerics+myentity(myarch)
#                         Verilog Design Unit: -bitscalars+Demux
#                         Library and du :     -primitiveaccess+work.mux
#                         Du and Inst:         -linedebug+dut/r
#                         Instance and below:  -assertdebug+/top/u1.
#                         Object:              -randmetastable+/top/myreg
#                         Region and below:    -fsmdebug+'/top/gen(3).'
#                         Region and 2 levels below: -nobitscalars+'/top/gen(3)+2'
# 
#           Most of these options can be negated by adding 'no' prefix to them.
#           These no* options allow objects to be optimized and they can also
#           take <selection> and <recurse_level> modifilers.
#   +[no]acc[=<spec>][+<selection>[+<recurse_level>|.]]
#                      Enable/disable access to certain objects.

#                      Do not lock down generic values during optimization.
#                      This enables use of the vsim -g/G options on the affected

#                      kinds of constructs.
#                      <spec> consists of one or more of the following letter codes:

#                      The <selection>, <recurse_level> and '.'modifiers are

#              [<library>.]<design_unit>/<inst_path> (for Verilog/VHDL instances)
#           When [<library>.]<design_unit> is specified, all instances of that
#           design unit from the specified <library> are affected by this
#           option. If <library> is not specified, all instances of that design
#           unit are considered. In VHDL, a user may further qualify the
#           selection using <architecture>.
#           When +<inst_name> is specified, only objects in that part of the
#           design are affected.
#           If a trailing '.' is present, the option is also applied recursively
#           downwards. Or, a user can specify the number of recursion levels
#           (0 to 127) with this option. Recursion level 128 indicates full
#           recursion.
# 
#                      Examples:
#                         VHDL Design Unit:    -floatgenerics+myentity(myarch)
#                         Verilog Design Unit: -bitscalars+Demux
#                         Library and du :     -primitiveaccess+work.mux
#                         Du and Inst:         -linedebug+dut/r
#                         Instance and below:  -assertdebug+/top/u1.
#                         Object:              -randmetastable+/top/myreg
#                         Region and below:    -fsmdebug+'/top/gen(3).'
#                         Region and 2 levels below: -nobitscalars+'/top/gen(3)+2'
# 
#           Most of these options can be negated by adding 'no' prefix to them.
#           These no* options allow objects to be optimized and they can also
#           take <selection> and <recurse_level> modifilers.
