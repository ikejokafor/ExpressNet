	First, the delay-feedback approaches are always more efficient
	than corresponding delay-commutator approaches in
	terms of memory utilization since the stored butterfly output
	can be directly used by the multipliers. Second, radix-4 algorithm
	based single-path architectures have higher multiplier
	utilization, however, radix-2 algorithm based architectures
	have simpler butterflies which are better utilized.

	If total reconfig time will be of issue, using a larger fft engine for smaller simaltenaouts fft's can be done
		less power in the long run as well
	use CMM and CSA which replaces multiplcaition with addition and shifting but we have DSP blocks so use em
