Map Depth and Kernel depth fit in Quad

Map depth is spread across quads, kernel depth fits in quads

Map depth is spread across quads, kernel depth must be iterated


FAS can handle up to N AWPs
the partial map in buffer will be a fifo with a minimum of one row for now to keep up with system read and write latencies
the feature map in will be a small fifo 2 or 3x the amount of pixels that can come in from system memory
Each quad is going to send its data along with an ID identifying each quad it is
    Each AWP is going to be numbered 0 to N
        Each quad of each AWP is going to be numbered 0 to N
        THe ID is the concat of both
The FAS's will have config data to say which quads it may need to accumulate against
each QUAD slot is potentially connected to every other quad slot because it may have to accum with
    any other quad or quad subset
    
break QUADs into groups of four. Call them AWPs
Within an AWP there is only one case where quads have to accum across each other

0 Q
1 Q_C
2 Q_C
3 Q

    Quads 0 and 3 must accum
    
For pooling
    first cycle does subtraction, second cycle gets local max, then third cycle compares to global
    max for that window. For smaller window sizes, just make irrelvant values -infin


create communication pathway between software and hardware / model
inject model with real data to verify correct data flow
Finish hardware
    write FAS unit
    get into DSP's to load Bias
    throw down AXI interconnect


FAS is going to have 3 slave spaces
    1 for interconnect
    1 for FAS cfg
    1 for QUAD cfg
