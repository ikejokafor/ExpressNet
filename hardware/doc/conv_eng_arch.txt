M outputs U and V which are partial products of
A * B and inputs to X and Y

P is internal accum reg for MACC operations

ALMODE => 0000 is
Z + W + X + Y + CIN
    CIN is 0 so
        Z + W + X + Y

        
Combinational so opcode must be ready before clock edge 

On new map

    W   Z  Y  X
    01 000 01 01  => P = P + (U + V)        Cycles 1 - 4

    W   Z  Y  X
    01 001 01 01  => P = P + (U + V) + PCIN    5th cycle
        
        
Subsequent Values       
    W   Z  Y  X
    00 000 01 01  => P = (U + V)    1st cycle
            
    W   Z  Y  X
    01 000 01 01  => P = P + (U + V)    Cycles 2 - 4

    W   Z  Y  X
    01 001 01 01  => P = P + (U + V) + PCIN    5th cycle, accum reg is also reset

WRT 5x clock, if it takes 5 cycles to output the whole window, then it will take 5 cycles for the reult to output
    The final value which the prev quad produces which needs to be added to the next quad is only needed on the
    next quads 5th cycle. So you just need to time it so that the value is ready in time
    Best to put a shallow fifo between the quads and the subsequent quad will not start until the fifo has atleast
    one element in it
