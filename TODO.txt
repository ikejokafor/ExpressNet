    Hang when using a bitstream built with Vivado 2018.3.1
    When running the demonstration program host_hbm with an ADM-PCIE-9H7 that has been configured with a
    host_hbm bitstream built using Vivado 2018.3.1, the program might hang after displaying the message
    INFO: Testing HBM bank 0 range 0x0 - 0x1000000 using CPU ...

    Because this appears to result from a hang condition on an AXI channel somewhere, the DMA transfer cannot be
    aborted and the program does not respond to CTRL-C. After issuing a CTRL-C, the adxdma_reset utility of the
    ADXDMA Driver can be used to abort the program, resetting the XDMA PCI Express endpoint and all
    downstream logic in the process.
    The root cause of this is not known at present, and using Vivado 2019.1 is recommended instead.

    Check if count on fifos changes automatically when read latency is high
    
    testing opcode 16 functionality. Need to add logic to verification framework which will generate and inject
    input img data, generate convMap result of data and send over AWP FAS interconnect, and store data to memory

    Change signal spec to look more like axi, read and wrtie groups for every possible initiator
 


There should be one input map address per AWP, one row for entire depth across all AWPâ€™s quads is 
fetched at a time, address is incremented as such.s. counters inside AWP will dictate which 
quad data goes to. Within FAS, if not enough depth, (using counters to know), will send zeros 
to quads, again AWP will dictate which quads data goes to.


 
Interconnect will send data plus, strobe to know which pieces of data are valid
, use counters in AWP to determine signaling and where to send data to.
