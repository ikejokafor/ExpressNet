    Check if count on fifos changes automatically when read latency is high
    
    testing opcode 16 functionality. Need to add logic to verification framework which will generate and inject
    input img data, generate convMap result of data and send over AWP FAS interconnect, and store data to memory

    Change signal init and targ spec to look more like axi, read and wrtie groups for every possible initiator
 



In the model code for yolov3 4_CONVOLUTION, the output buffer dwc fifo still has data in it
    most likely an extra write is happening, fix it and add it to conditional clauses for S_Process
    and in the complete state
