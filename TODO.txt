    Hang when using a bitstream built with Vivado 2018.3.1
    When running the demonstration program host_hbm with an ADM-PCIE-9H7 that has been configured with a
    host_hbm bitstream built using Vivado 2018.3.1, the program might hang after displaying the message
    INFO: Testing HBM bank 0 range 0x0 - 0x1000000 using CPU ...

    Because this appears to result from a hang condition on an AXI channel somewhere, the DMA transfer cannot be
    aborted and the program does not respond to CTRL-C. After issuing a CTRL-C, the adxdma_reset utility of the
    ADXDMA Driver can be used to abort the program, resetting the XDMA PCI Express endpoint and all
    downstream logic in the process.
    The root cause of this is not known at present, and using Vivado 2019.1 is recommended instead.
